# TWITTER SCHEDULE POST

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this project.

This project was designed as my Final project for my [Harvard CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/project/) course.


## The Problem

Although, I've always had content to post on twitter but for some reason I've always struggled to open the app to post the content on a consistent basis.

So I have decided to create a tool that will automatically post tweets for me on a daily basis.


## The Project

The Project is to build a tool that I can use to schedule tweets everyday.

Some of the intended features include;
- Create Tweet
- Schedule the tweet either by date
- Schedule the tweet either by priority
- If no date it'll pick the tweet that has not been tweeted
- Choose number of tweets per day

## My process

- Wrote the front-end code (HTML, CSS and JS) for 3 pages Login/Index, tweets and register
- Worked on the server either Node (Using MVC pattern)
- Created database Either MySQL or MongoDB
- Connect the app to the Twitter API
- Host the Application

### Built with

<!-- - Bootstrap Grid
- WordPress
- Mobile first
- Lazy Loading images -->



## My Proposed Improvements
<!-- - Improve Google page speed insights from 95% to 100%
- Make HTML more readable
- Make CSS more readable -->


<!--
1. Create server
2. Create Login Page and sessions (Look at finance app)
3. Verify the Login Process
4. If the user is me or if the user has signed in to twitter then let them create a scheduler
5. Create a Todo Front-end template that allows users schedule Post
6. Create Databses for user Login and twitter post (Password Should be harshed)
7. Create an index for the preferable columns in the tables

MODEL - User Table(Username, Password_harsh, Email Address, ), tweets (Tweet (Less than 280 Characters), Date(Only 3 in one day), Priority(1 is highest priority), status(Done or blank))
